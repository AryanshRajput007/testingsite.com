    <h3>What is User ?</h3>
    <p>A user in a DBMS is an individual or an application that interacts with the database to perform various operations such as querying data, inserting new data, updating existing data, and deleting data. Users can be categorized into different types based on their level of access and privileges. </p>
    <h3>Some common types of users are listed below :-</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Naive Users (End Users) :-</strong> These are the individuals who access the database through front-end applications or interfaces to retrieve information or perform specific tasks relevant to their job roles. <strong><p>E.g:</strong> Clerk in bank</p></li>
        <strong><li>Application Users :-</strong> These are users associated with specific software applications that interact with the database. For example, a web application that allows users to shop online will have users interacting with the database to view products, place orders, etc. They are the programmers who write software using tools such as Java, .Net, PHP etc. <strong><p>E.g:</strong> Software developers</p></li>
        <strong><li>Sophisticated Users :-</strong> Sophisticated users are individuals or professionals who possess an advanced level of knowledge, expertise, and skills in working with databases. These users are highly proficient in using the DBMS and are well-versed in various database-related tasks and concepts. They interact with database system without using an application program. They use query tools like SQL. <strong><p>E.g:</strong> Analyst</p></li>
        <strong><li>Specialized Users (DBA) :-</strong> A specialized user is an individual who has expertise in a particular domain or area of a database application. These users have in-depth knowledge of specific functionalities or modules of the database system that cater to their specialized needs. They are the user who writes specialized database applications program and they use administration tools. <strong><p>E.g:</strong> Database Administrator</p></li>
    </ol>
    <strong><h3>What is DBA ?</h3></strong>
    <p>DBA stands for <strong>"Database Administrator"</strong>. In brief, a DBA is a skilled IT professional responsible for managing and maintaining the database management system (DBMS) and the underlying databases in an organization. The role of a DBA is critical as databases serve as the backbone of many software applications and store vast amounts of valuable data.</p>
    <h3>The key responsibilities of a DBA include:</h3>
    <ol>
        <strong><li>Schema Definition :-</strong> DBA defines the logical schema of the database.</li>
        <strong><li>Database Installation and Configuration :-</strong> Setting up the DBMS software and configuring the initial database environment.</li>
        <strong><li>Monitoring Performance :-</strong> DBA ensures that better performance is maintained by making a change in the physical or logical schema if required.</li>
        <strong><li>Storage Structure and Access Method Definition :-</strong> DBA decides how the data is to be represented in the database & how to access it.</li>
        <strong><li>Security Management :-</strong> Implementing security measures to protect the database from unauthorized access and ensuring data privacy.</li>
        <strong><li>Backup and Recovery :-</strong> Establishing backup and recovery strategies to safeguard data and enable data restoration in case of hardware failures or disasters.</li>
        <strong><li>Troubleshooting :-</strong> Identifying and resolving database-related issues and incidents to maintain system availability and reliability.</li>
        <strong><li>Granting of Authorization for Data Access :-</strong> DBA determines which user needs access to which part of the database.</li>
